# RadISpeC
Radiation Interface for Matlab Spectroscopy Calculations (RadISpeC) is a program that use HITRAN/HITEMP data to generate Line-by-Line (LBL) spectra at a wanted spectral resolution and environment. These data can be used with Discrete Transer Methods (DTM), Ray Tracing (RT) etc. solvers to estimate high precision radiation in heated flow problems. 

It was created as a part of the article "Experimental and theoretical evaluation of spectral radiative transfer in high-pressure flames" 
by Westly et. al. from 2018. This article also show how good the program is at simulating heated gas flows for CO2, H2O and CO compared to experimental results. The program contain all setups that was used for the article to use free of charge, as long as the program and article is cited.

All functions have descriptions that explain how to use them and contain call methods. If a more detailed description of theory is wanted, check the RadISpeC documentation PDF inside the RadISpeC folder. This PDF also contain the same information as the function descriptions.
